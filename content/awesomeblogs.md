You would find here a curated list of blogs that I love reading. This is in no way a complete list. 
Occasionaly I come across a new blog and find a whole treasure trove when I check out their other writings. I will try my best to keep this list updated as I find new awesome people on the internet. 

The list is made into two parts : Machine Learning and Systems. They are in no particular order. 
## Machine Learning 
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, LLMs, ML for Systems, Systems for ML etc.
