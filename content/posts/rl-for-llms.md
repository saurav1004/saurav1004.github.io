The year of 2024 was of RL algorithms. Numerous new algorithms were applied for Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models. As someone working with these methods or LLMs in general, it becomes crucial to understand the internals of these algorithms and how they relate to each other. And not just that, but answering why did we do that small change, was it really necessary, was it worth it ? and so on.
