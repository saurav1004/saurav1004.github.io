### Meta Engineering / Meta Research

It's a compelling perspective to see everything as a system. Within this view, systems that generate new systems—what we might call 'meta-systems'—hold particular importance. While these foundational meta-systems are deeply personal and unique to their creators, a comparative look often reveals common underlying components and patterns that humans frequently employ in their systemic thinking and building. 

Following researchers and engineers write about there systems in a lot of detail. I hate the fact that this is highly concentrated in the domain of CS and Machine Learning. But a large majority of the subsystems apply across domains. Check out their writings here :
