### about this blog 
Iâ€™m no writer by trade; I write to make sense of my thoughts. This blog is a collection of my old and new notes made into short essays and writeups. 

### Saurav Panigrahi
(meta)Engineer / Researcher / Realist <br />

You can reach out to me [@sauravlmx](https://x.com/sauravlmx).
I consider myself a hardcore realist to the point that I have come up with a [**Realist's Manifesto**](content/posts/realist.md).

I maintain a list of my favorite blogs on systems, machine learning and meta engineering. Access it [here](https://narrowfoc.us/linklog). 

There is also a reading list (of books and papers) I have partially read, or I want to read. Access the reading list [here](https://narrowfoc.us/reading).
