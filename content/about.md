## this blog 
I’m no writer by trade; I write to make sense of my thoughts. This blog is a collection of my old and new notes made into short essays and writeups.

### Saurav Panigrahi
(meta)Engineer / Realist <br />

You can reach out to me [@sauravlmx](https://x.com/sauravlmx). 
I consider myself a hardcore realist to the point that I have come up with a **Realist's Manifesto**. If you are interested, follow along, Or feel free to check out my other posts. 

I also maintain a list of articles from the deepest corners of the internet because google search results are horse shit. Access it [here](https://narrowfoc.us/linklog). 

**The Realist’s Manifesto:**

1. Human beings are trapped in endless cycles of introspection. Realism breaks this cycle by driving people to take action and move forward.
2. Realism values shorter feedback loops, leading to faster iterations and deeper understanding.
3. It insists on a bias for **action** and the need for testability. Fail fast and learn.
4. Actions are rooted in simple systems and first principles. 
5. Systems are built from basic, fundamental, measurable elements called the primitives. Discipline is a primitive; passion is not. Discipline can be measured, passion cannot. 
6. Systems are observed, evaluated, and adapted over time.
7. Over time, systems evolve into building blocks for even more complex systems.
8. Complex systems are nonlinear but often reveal emergent properties at scale. This is how structure, through simple systems, fosters creativity.
9. Systems are the ultimate form of leverage, leading to success and progress.

**The Realist’s Code of Conduct:**

1. Realists don’t dwell in their thoughts.
2. Realists build systems and take action.
3. Realists face reality head-on. If a system fails, it hits hard, and they confront it.
4. Realists are determined, not fanatical. If something isn’t working, they want to know and they want to fix it.
5. Realists embrace the truth, however harsh. They adjust, adapt, and move forward.
6. Realists prioritise results over ideals.
