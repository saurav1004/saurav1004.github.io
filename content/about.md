### about this blog 
Iâ€™m no writer by trade; I write to make sense of my thoughts. This blog is a collection of my old and new notes made into short essays and writeups. 

### Saurav Panigrahi
Research Engineer / Realist <br />

I work on LLMs at Zoho. <br />
My research interests include : post training methods, faithful reasoning models, verification systems and (practical) mechanistic interpretability. 

I am also studying the different ways we can look at the impact of Data on large model training. 

You can reach out to me [**@sauravlmx**](https://x.com/sauravlmx).
I consider myself a hardcore realist to the point that I have come up with a [**Realist's Manifesto**](https://narrowfoc.us/posts/realist).

I maintain a list of my favorite blogs on systems, machine learning and meta engineering. Access it [here](https://narrowfoc.us/linklog). 

There is also a reading list (of books and papers) I have partially read, or I want to read. Access the reading list [here](https://narrowfoc.us/reading).
