I consider myself a hardcore realist to the point that I have come up with a <strong>Realist&rsquo;s Manifesto</strong>. If you are interested, follow along, Or feel free to check out my other posts.</p>
<p><strong>The Realist’s Manifesto:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Human beings are trapped in endless cycles of introspection. Realism breaks this cycle by driving people to take action and move forward.</li>
<li>Realism values shorter feedback loops, leading to faster iterations and deeper understanding.</li>
<li>It insists on a bias for <strong>action</strong> and the need for testability. Fail fast and learn.</li>
<li>Actions are rooted in simple systems and first principles.</li>
<li>Systems are built from basic, fundamental, measurable elements called the primitives. Discipline is a primitive; passion is not. Discipline can be measured, passion cannot.</li>
<li>Systems are observed, evaluated, and adapted over time.</li>
<li>Over time, systems evolve into building blocks for even more complex systems.</li>
<li>Complex systems are nonlinear but often reveal emergent properties at scale. This is how structure, through simple systems, fosters creativity.</li>
<li>Systems are the ultimate form of leverage, leading to success and progress.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Realist’s Code of Conduct:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Realists don’t dwell in their thoughts.</li>
<li>Realists build systems and take action.</li>
<li>Realists face reality head-on. If a system fails, it hits hard, and they confront it.</li>
<li>Realists are determined, not fanatical. If something isn’t working, they want to know and they want to fix it.</li>
<li>Realists embrace the truth, however harsh. They adjust, adapt, and move forward.</li>
<li>Realists prioritise results over ideals.</li>
</ol>
