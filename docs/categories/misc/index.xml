      <title>Log Sum Exp in Pytorch</title>

      <description>&amp;ndash; old post &amp;ndash;&#xA;When working with PyTorch for classification tasks, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter a common pattern: your model outputs raw scores (called logits), and you feed these directly into a loss function like nn.CrossEntropyLoss without first converting them to probabilities.&#xA;This might seem counterintuitive. Why not take the logical step of applying the softmax function to get probabilities first? This article explores the question and explains the clever reason behind PyTorch&amp;rsquo;s design.</description>

      <title>The Realist’s Manifesto</title>

      <description>The Realist’s Manifesto:&#xA;Human beings are trapped in endless cycles of introspection. Realism breaks this cycle by driving people to take action and move forward. Realism values shorter feedback loops, leading to faster iterations and deeper understanding. It insists on a bias for action and the need for testability. Fail fast and learn. Actions are rooted in simple systems and first principles. Systems are built from basic, fundamental, measurable elements called the primitives.</description>
