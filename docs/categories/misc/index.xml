      <title>Numerical Stability in Pytorch</title>

      <description>&amp;ndash; old post &amp;ndash; # &amp;ndash; maintainence notice : I wrote this post long back, and have moved multiple templates / static site generators in the meantime. Most expressions should just work fine. But it might be breaking in some places, thanks for bearing with it. &amp;ndash; # The core of training a deep neural network is gradient-based optimization. We calculate how the model&amp;rsquo;s error changes with respect to each of its millions (or billions) of parameters and take a small step in the direction that reduces that error.</description>

Most expressions should just work fine. But it might be breaking in some places, thanks for bearing with it. &amp;ndash;&#xA;When working with PyTorch for classification tasks, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter a common pattern: your model outputs raw scores (called logits), and you feed these directly into a loss function like nn.</description>

      <title>The Realist’s Manifesto</title>

      <description>The Realist’s Manifesto:&#xA;Human beings are trapped in endless cycles of introspection. Realism breaks this cycle by driving people to take action and move forward. Realism values shorter feedback loops, leading to faster iterations and deeper understanding. It insists on a bias for action and the need for testability. Fail fast and learn. Actions are rooted in simple systems and first principles. Systems are built from basic, fundamental, measurable elements called the primitives.</description>
