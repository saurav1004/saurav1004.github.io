      <description>On Writing as a Tool for Thought # If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.&#xA;Writing is, for many, a formidable task. The difficulty often stems not from the mechanics of language but from a dual uncertainty: a lack of clarity about the subject and an anxiety about how their words will shape perception. There have been countless pieces of writing on how to overcome these problems.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; old post &amp;ndash; # &amp;ndash; maintainence notice : I wrote this post long back, and have moved multiple templates / static site generators in the meantime. Most expressions should just work fine. But it might be breaking in some places, thanks for bearing with it. &amp;ndash; # The core of training a deep neural network is gradient-based optimization. We calculate how the model&amp;rsquo;s error changes with respect to each of its millions (or billions) of parameters and take a small step in the direction that reduces that error.</description>

Most expressions should just work fine. But it might be breaking in some places, thanks for bearing with it. &amp;ndash; # When working with PyTorch for classification tasks, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter a common pattern: your model outputs raw scores (called logits), and you feed these directly into a loss function like nn.</description>

      <description>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte‚Äôs books and handouts. Tufte‚Äôs style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.‚ö† This demo page is a technical replicate of the original Tufte CSS page on Edward Tufte&amp;rsquo;s GitHub site. Information may not accurately reflect features of the hugo-tufte theme. Tufte CSS was created by Dave Liepmann and is now an Edward Tufte project.</description>

      <title>The Realist‚Äôs Manifesto</title>
      <link>https://saurav1004.github.io/posts/realist/</link>

      <description>The Realist‚Äôs Manifesto:&#xA;Human beings are trapped in endless cycles of introspection. Realism breaks this cycle by driving people to take action and move forward. Realism values shorter feedback loops, leading to faster iterations and deeper understanding. It insists on a bias for action and the need for testability. Fail fast and learn. Actions are rooted in simple systems and first principles. Systems are built from basic, fundamental, measurable elements called the primitives.</description>
